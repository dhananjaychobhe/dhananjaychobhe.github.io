    <p><b>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar</b> (born 24 April 1973) is a former international 
      cricketer of India who served as captain of the Indian national team. He is widely 
      regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[6] He is the highest 
      run scorer of all time in international cricket, and the only player to have scored one hundred 
      international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), 
      the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI cricket, and the only player to complete more
      than 30,000 runs in international cricket. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test 
      World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[8][9][10] He is affectionately 
      known as "Little Master" or "Master Blaster". </p>
